Hi.
Today I came to introduce you to a content management system.
This content management system is mine and you can use it to build with that site.
learn inistallation:
1. You need to create a database within phpmyadmin.
2. Import the table file in phpmyadmin.
3. Open the config.php file
In the dbname = field, enter the name of the database.
In the DB_USERNAME section, enter the database username.
  In the DB_PASSWORD section, enter the database password.
Write your username in the ADMIN_USERNAME field.
Enter your password in the ADMIN_PASSWORD field.
The end of the content management system is ready
